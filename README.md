About This Project
This project was developed as part of the Automation & AI course, demonstrating the integration of multiple technologies to solve real-world business problems. It showcases my ability to:

Design and implement full-stack applications from concept to deployment
Integrate multiple APIs and cloud services seamlessly
Create intuitive, user-friendly interfaces for complex systems
Deploy and maintain cloud-based solutions on free-tier infrastructure
Document technical implementations effectively for various audiences
Think critically about user needs and business value
Balance technical sophistication with accessibility

The Madison Sales Intelligence Agent represents my approach to modern software development: combining automation, artificial intelligence, and thoughtful design to create tools that genuinely improve how people work.
